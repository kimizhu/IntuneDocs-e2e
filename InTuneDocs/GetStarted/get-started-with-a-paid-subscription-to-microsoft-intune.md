# Get started with a paid subscription to Microsoft Intune
Whether you start with a 30-day free trial, or start with a paid subscription, Microsoft Intune provides a quick and easy way for you to manage mobile devices and computers in your organization. This getting started topic leads you through the steps of setting up a cloud-only instance of [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](./includes/wit_firstref_md.md)].

Getting started with a paid subscription of Intune shares many of the same steps as starting with a [free 30-day trial](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646983.aspx). However in this topic, you'll also cover some additional areas that most people might not need to address in trial deployments, including:

-   Synchronizing on-premises Active Directory accounts with Intune and Azure Active Directory

-   Domain and DNS service considerations

-   Customizing Intune features for production use

This topic focuses on configuring Intune as a standalone service. If you're currently using Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) to manage computers and servers, you can connect Intune with ConfgMgr in a hybrid deployment. This configuration offers several benefits and leverages your existing on-premises infrastructure. See [Manage Mobile Devices with Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj884158.aspx) for more information about hybrid Intune and ConfigMgr deployments.

NOTE: If you purchase at least 150 licenses for Microsoft Intune in an eligible plan, you can use the "FastTrack Center Benefit," a service where Microsoft specialists work with you to get your environment ready for Intune. See [Microsoft Intune Service Benefit Description](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt228265.aspx).

## Before you begin
Starting with a paid subscription means that you've [completed an Intune trial](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646983.aspx) and that you're ready to deploy Intune and make changes to your existing network infrastructure. This could range from simply adding or updating your internal and external DNS records to connecting your existing Active Directory accounts to Azure Active Directory. Whatever mix of Intune  mobile device management features you leverage, you'll need to  carefully plan how Intune will interact with your existing network components and services. Specifically, you should review:

-   **How you'll manage user identity**:  For most medium-level and enterprise-level organizations, connecting your existing directory services to Intune via Azure Active Directory is the best and most convenient way to manage user identity with Intune. This is especially true if you already use other Microsoft cloud services, such as Office 365 or Exchange Online. Synchronizing your existing user accounts using [Microsoft's AD Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594) is a quick and easy way to connect your on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory and configure a single sign-on authentication experience for your users.

-   **How DNS will be impacted**: If you want to use your own domain name instead of the default onmicrosoft.com domain generated by the Intune service, some public DNS record updates will be needed when configuring Azure (or other Microsoft cloud services) to use your custom domain. DNS records are required so that mobile devices can locate the Intune service, as well as making other mobility management services work correctly. You'll need to decide if you want  to manage your DNS records at your DNS host  or have Azure or Office 365 create and manage the DNS records for your domain after you change your DNS records to point to these services.

Ready to get started? You'll need the following when starting your paid subscription to Intune:

-   A device with a Silverlight-enabled web browser that you can use to access the websites where you'll  create Intune user accounts (the **Intune Account Portal**) and where you'll manage devices, groups, and policies  (the **Intune administration console**).

-   A second device with a web browser, which you can use to access the company portal to see how most [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] users will enroll and manage their devices, find and install software, and request help from administrators. Instead of using a second device with a web browser, you can use the “privacy mode” setting on the same browser that you use for [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] administration (for example: in Internet Explorer, you can click **Tools** &gt; **InPrivate Browsing**).

-   If you have an existing Microsoft Online Services account, you'll need the administrator credentials for that account. If you don’t have such an account, or if you want to use this Intune tenant for evaluation purposes only, you don't need tenant administrator credentials.

-   If you'll manage iOS or Windows Phone devices with Intune, you'll need certificates (or keys) and accounts to retrieve those certificates. Android devices don't need any additional certificates:

    |Platform|Certificate Requirements|More information|
    |------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
    |Windows Phone 8.1 and [!INCLUDE[winphone8_client_1](./includes/winphone8_client_1_md.md)]|No certificate is required for Windows Phone 8.1 users who install the company portal app from the Store. A Symantec certificate is required for Windows Phone 8.0 or to use Intune to deploy the company portal app to Windows Phone 8.1 devices.|This guidance assumes your users get the company portal app from the Store on a Windows Phone 8.1 or later device. For information about Windows Phone 8.0 support, see [Set up Windows Phone management with Microsoft Intune](set-up-windows-phone-management-with-microsoft-intune.md).|
    |Windows 10, [!INCLUDE[winblue_winrt_2](./includes/winblue_winrt_2_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[win8RT_client_1](./includes/win8RT_client_1_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[winblue_client_2](./includes/winblue_client_2_md.md)] devices|There are no certificate requirements for enrolling Windows RT and Windows devices.|[Install the Windows PC client with Microsoft Intune](install-the-windows-pc-client-with-microsoft-intune.md).|
    |iOS or Mac OS X|Get an Apple Push Notification service certificate.|Request an Apple Push Notification service certificate from Apple, as described here: [Set up iOS and Mac management with Microsoft Intune](set-up-ios-and-mac-management-with-microsoft-intune.md).|






## <a name="Step4"></a>Step 6: Create policies and publish an app
[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] policies provide settings that help you control the security settings on mobile devices, maintain Windows Firewall and Endpoint Protection settings for computers, and deploy applications. If you are planning to use Intune for devices that you configure for production use after the trial, it's absolutely essential that you follow the instructions in [Manage settings and features on your devices with Microsoft Intune policies](manage-settings-and-features-on-your-devices-with-microsoft-intune-policies.md) and [Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune](help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune.md).

You can perform two types of app installations using Intune. The first is a **required install**, which automatically deploys the app to managed computers. The other is an **available install**, which deploys the app, or a link to the app, to the Intune company portal so that users can choose whether to install it on their computers or on their mobile devices.

Before using Intune to deploy apps, make sure that you have the appropriate licenses to publish, distribute, and use the app. The Licenses workspace lets you add and manage license agreement information for apps or software purchased through Microsoft Volume Licensing agreements, and for Microsoft or non-Microsoft software that was purchased by other means. You can then create license reports that display managed license usage information throughout your company to stay informed of license usage activity.

In these steps, you'll set up a mobile device configuration policy and a Windows computer firewall policy, and configure Skype as an available install for mobile devices after they're enrolled. After you add and deploy a new policy, all users or devices in the group to which you deployed the policy inherit the settings as their baseline policy. You can always review and edit the details of these policies later from the Policy workspace.

#### Create and deploy a mobile device configuration policy

1.  Open the [Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/).

2.  In the left pane, click the **Policy** icon.

3.  In the **Tasks** list on the **Policy Overview** page, click **Add Policy**.

4.  In the policy list, expand the platform you want to create a policy for, then select **General Configuration**, choose **Create and Deploy a Policy with the Recommended Settings**, and then click **Create Policy**.

5.  When prompted to **Select the groups to which you want to deploy this policy**, select **My Trial Users** from the list, and click **Add** &gt; **OK**.

Your policy appears in the list of configuration policies, and has been deployed to the **My Trial Users** group. Double-click the policy to view its settings.

#### Publish the Skype app for mobile devices

1.  In the [Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), click the **Apps** icon, then click **Apps** &gt; **Add App**. If prompted, enter your [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] credentials.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you start the **Intune Software Publisher** for the first time, a short delay occurs while the application is installed.

2.  Review the security warning and click **Run**.

3.  On the **Before you begin** page, click **Next**.

4.  On the **Software setup** page in **Select how this software is made available to devices**, select **External link**.

5.  Enter the external link for the software in **Specify the URL**, and then click **Next**. Make sure that you preface the URL with **http://**. For the Skype app, use the link below that matches the mobile device platform you're using:

    -   **iOS:**[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510?mt%3D8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510?mt%3D8)

    -   **Android:**[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider)

    -   **Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone 8.1:**[http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/skype/c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/skype/c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51)

6.  On the **Software description** page, provide the information that you want users to see in the company portal for the software, and then click **Next**. The following settings are available (this example refers to Skype):

    -   **Publisher:** Enter the name of the publisher, "Microsoft"

    -   **Name:** Enter **Skype**

    -   **Description:** Enter a description for the software, such as **Skype communication app**

    -   **Category:** Select the category that best fits this software, such as **Collaboration**

    -   **Display this as a featured app and highlight it in the company portal:** Select this option to display the app prominently in the company portal on mobile devices.

    -   **Icon:** Choose whether to associate an icon with the software. The maximum size for the icon is 250 x 250 pixels. The recommended size is 32 x 32 pixels. This setting is optional for the Intune trial tenant.

10. On the **Deployment Action** page, select **Available Install** from the **Approval** column for your group.

11. Click **Finish**.

The Skype app is now available to install on mobile devices from the company portal, but first you need to install [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] software on computers and mobile devices.

## <a name="BKMK_ConfigureCompanyPortal"></a>Step 7: Customize the company portal
The [!INCLUDE[wit_iwportal_1](./includes/wit_iwportal_1_md.md)] is where users access company data and can do common tasks like enrolling devices, installing apps, and locating information for assistance from your IT department.

When you customize the company portal, the configurations apply to both the company portal website and company portal apps.

### <a name="BKMK_ToCustomizeCompanyPortal"></a>Settings for customizing the company portal

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administrator console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Admin** &gt; **Company Portal**.

2.  Configure one or more of the following optional items.

    |Configuration area|Field name|Maximum character length|More information|

    ||Choose a background for [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](./includes/win8_client_2_md.md)] company portal app|Not applicable|This setting affects the background for the [!INCLUDE[win8_client_2](./includes/win8_client_2_md.md)] company portal app only.|

3.  Click **Save** to save your changes.

After you save your changes, you can use the links provided at the bottom of the **Company Portal** page of the administration console to view the company portal website. These links cannot be changed. When a user signs in, these links display your subscriptions in the company portal.

## <a name="Step5"></a>Step 8: Enroll computers in Intune
You can install the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] client software on computers in the following ways:

-   Users can use an installer provided by the administrator to manually enroll

-   [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] software can be included in an OS image or deployed using Group Policy

-   End users can also self-enroll their devices through the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](./includes/wit_firstref_md.md)] company portal

Each enrolled computer is linked to the user account that was used to install the client software. Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection is also installed by default during Intune client installation on computers. Endpoint Protection helps to secure the computers in your organization by providing real-time protection against potential threats, keeping malicious software definitions up to date, and automatically running scheduled scans. For added security, you can also use Intune policies to manage Windows Firewall settings on managed computers.

What to know before you start:

-   The user must be an administrator on the computer to install the client software.

-   Self-enrolling requires that Internet Explorer is installed on the client computer.

-   Each time a user self-enrolls a computer, it uses a [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](./includes/wit_firstref_md.md)] license.

-   You must use a Microsoft Online Services work or school account to self-enroll a computer. This is the account that you used to sign in, or the administrator account that was created when you signed up for the free trial.

For this example, you'll use the self-enrollment approach:

1.  In the [Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), click **Admin** &gt; **Company Portal**, and then scroll to the bottom of the screen. Copy the URL shown under **Intune company portal**.

2.  Use Internet Explorer to browse to the company portal URL that you acquired in the previous step, and log in with your administrator credentials.

3.  Click **Add Device**.

4.  Click **Download Software** and then click **Run**.

5.  Click **Next** to start the [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](./includes/wit_firstref_md.md)] Setup wizard.

6.  When the Setup wizard has completed, click **Finish**.

## <a name="Step6"></a>Step 9: Enroll mobile devices and install an app
To set up mobile device management with Intune, you must  first set the mobile device management authority,  enable management for device platforms, and enroll your devices with the company portal app. You can then deploy the Microsoft Skype application that you published.

#### Enable device management and enroll devices

1.  **Make Intune your mobile device management authority**
    In the [Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), click **Admin** &gt; **Mobile Device Management**, and click **Set MDM Authority** under **Tasks**.  Click **Yes** in the MDM Authority dialog box.

2.  **Enable MDM for your device platform**
    Enable mobile device management for the device platform you want to manage. Depending on your platform, different requirements are needed:

    -   **iOS and Mac OS X**: see [Set up iOS and Mac management with Microsoft Intune](set-up-ios-and-mac-management-with-microsoft-intune.md).

    -   **Windows Phone**: see [Set up Windows Phone management with Microsoft Intune](set-up-windows-phone-management-with-microsoft-intune.md).

    -   **Android**: Android mobile devices allow users to enroll using the company portal app available from Google Play. No additional configuration in Intune is required.

3.  **Enroll devices**:

    -   **Android** - Install the **Intune Company Portal** app from Microsoft Corporation available on [Google Play](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=386612) and sign in with the Intune user credentials added above.

    -   **iOS and Mac OS X** - Install the **Microsoft Intune Company Portal** app from Microsoft Corporation available in the App Store and sign in with the Intune user credentials added above. View **Enrolled devices** to add your device.

    -   **Windows Phone 8.1**- Users install the **Company Portal** app from Microsoft Corporation available in the Windows Phone store and sign in with the Intune user credentials added above.  View **Enrolled devices** to add your device.

    -   **Windows Phone 8.0**  - Users click **system settings** &gt; **company apps**, and sign in with Intune user credentials added above. The company portal app is deployed to your phone.

    If prompted for a **Server address**, type “manage.microsoft.com”.

4.  Open the company portal on the mobile device, choose **Apps**, and then install **Microsoft Skype**.

To learn more about mobile device management using [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)], see [Get ready to enroll devices in Microsoft Intune](get-ready-to-enroll-devices-in-microsoft-intune.md).

## Post-configuration tasks
After you complete the initial configuration steps for an Intune  paid subscription, you should consider enabling additional mobile device management functionality.

-   **Connect Exchange to Intune:** For users with mobile devices  that haven't  enrolled in Intune, you can enable Exchange ActiveSync management using a connector for on-premises Exchange and for Exchange Online in  Microsoft Office 365. The Exchange connector connects you with your Exchange deployment and lets you manage mobile devices through the Intune administration console. To learn more about the Exchange connector, see [Mobile device management with Exchange ActiveSync and Microsoft Intune](mobile-device-management-with-exchange-activesync-and-microsoft-intune.md).

-   **Intune reports:** Microsoft Intune provides alerts and reports that you can use to help monitor devices, as well as software license status and actions that affect devices (such as wiping a device).  To learn more about reporting, see [Monitoring and reports with Microsoft Intune](monitoring-and-reports-with-microsoft-intune.md).

-   **Protecting company resources:** After you've configured Intune and enrolled your devices, you'll want to make sure that you're protecting devices against data loss and other threats. To learn more about protecting resources, see [Protect data and devices with Microsoft Intune](protect-data-and-devices-with-microsoft-intune.md).
