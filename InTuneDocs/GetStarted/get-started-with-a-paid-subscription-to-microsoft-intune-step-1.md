# 1. Sign up or sign in to Intune
Before  you either sign up or sign in to Intune, consider:

-   Whether your organization already has a Microsoft Online Services work or school account

-   Or if your organization has an Enterprise Agreement or equivalent volume licensing agreement with Microsoft

## When to sign up for a new account

Sign up for a new account if either of the following is true:

- **You donâ€™t have a work or school account.** A work or school account is provided when you sign a volume licensing agreement with Microsoft or subscribe to Office 365. If your organization has not signed an Enterprise Agreement or equivalent volume licensing agreement with Microsoft (or has an Office 365 account), then you do not have a Microsoft Online Services account that you can use to sign in to Microsoft Online Services.
- **You will discard your Intune tenant after completing the 30-day trial.** You should sign up for a new account if you are using your [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] free trial subscription for evaluation purposes only, and you plan to redo your [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] service setup and device provisioning after the trial. This is the recommended option if you plan to use [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] with System Center 2012 Configuration Manager.

    If you sign up for a new account, you cannot later use an existing work or school account to manage that account, or combine it with existing volume licensing agreements.

## When to sign in with your work or school account
Sign in with your work or school account if:

- **You have a work or school account.** You have a work or school account provided with a volume licensing agreement or Office 365 subscription, and you are using this trial to evaluate [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)].**

    If you are setting up [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] on an existing account, we recommend that you review [Choose how to manage devices](/Intune/Understand/introduction-to-microsoft-intune.md) before continuing with these steps.

### Sign up or sign in to Intune

1.  Visit the [Intune Sign up](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=40BE278A-DFD1-470a-9EF7-9F2596EA7FF9&dl=INTUNE_A&ali=1#0%20) page.

2.  On the **Sign up** page, sign in or sign up.

If  you complete the sign-up process, you're automatically signed in to the [!INCLUDE[wit_icp_1](../includes/wit_icp_1_md.md)] with the tenant administrator account. An email message that contains your account information is also sent to the email address that you provided during sign-up. This email confirms your subscription is active. If you sign in, you're automatically directed to the Intune admin portal.
