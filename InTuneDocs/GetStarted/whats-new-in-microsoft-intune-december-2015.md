### Changes and updates to Microsoft Company Portal
The following changes have been made to the Company Portal in this release.

**Android Company Portal app**

The following changes have been made to comply with new Google requirements. On Android 6.0 and above devices, two new messages are displayed to users:
* Allow Company Portal to make and manage phone calls?
* Allow Company Portal to access photos, media, and files on your device?

See the following tables for details about these two messages.

**iOS Company Portal app**
* Users can now use Microsoft Outlook or other mail apps to send diagnostic logs to the IT administrator. Previously, only the native app could be used.
* Support has been improved for Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP) and corporate-enrolled devices. For details, see [You are asked to identify your device when you're trying to enroll](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt598622.aspx#BKMK_ios_id_your_device).
* In the user's list of enrolled devices, a green check mark now appears next to the device that the user is currently using. Before this check mark was added, users couldn't tell which enrolled device they were using.

**Windows Company Portal app**

Microsoft automatically collects anonymous data about the performance and use of the company portal to improve Microsoft products and services. End users can turn off data collection by using the Usage Data setting on their device, but administrators have no control over the data collection and cannot change the end userâ€™s selection for this setting.-->
