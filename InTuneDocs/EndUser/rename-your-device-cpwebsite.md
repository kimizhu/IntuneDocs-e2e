# Rename your device

If you decide to rename your device, you can do it remotely from the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com). The Company Portal website is a web page that you can use to manage computers and devices that you have enrolled in Intune and to do most of the same tasks that you can do when using your Company Portal app.

To rename your device:

1.  Open the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) and tap the device whose name you want to change.

2.  Tap **Rename**.

3.  In the box where your current device name appears, type the new name for your device, and then tap the **Rename** button. Your device now appears with the new name.
