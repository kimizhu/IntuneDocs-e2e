# Device doesn't have the required minimum operating system version

Your device doesnâ€™t meet the minimum operating system version required by your IT department. Before updating your device, check the current operating system version by tapping **Settings** &gt; **About phone**, and then check to see if an update is available for your device by tapping **Settings**, and then finding the update option.
