# Enroll your Mac OS X device in Intune

Enrolling your device in Intune enables you to access the companyâ€™s network, your work email and work files, and lets you get company apps. For more about what happens when you enroll your device, see [what-happens-when-you-install-the-Company-Portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md](What happens when you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?).

If you're trying to enroll an iOS device, see [enroll-your-ios-device-in-intune.md](Enroll your iOS device in Intune).

To enroll your Mac OS X device:

1.  Using a Safari browser, open the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com), and tap the notification bar.

2.  Tap **This device is either not enrolled or the Company Portal can't identify it**.
