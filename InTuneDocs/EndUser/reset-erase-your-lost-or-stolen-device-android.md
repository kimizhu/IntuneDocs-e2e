# Reset (erase) your lost or stolen device

If your phone is lost or stolen, you can reset it to factory defaults from the Company Portal app or website. For instructions using the Company Portal app, use the following steps, or watch this [video](http://aka.ms/ly1x17). To use the Company Portal website, see ___________________________.

To learn about what happens if you reset your device, see [What happens if you reset your device using the Company Portal](what-happens-if-you-reset-your-device-using-the-company-portal-android.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Resetting a device to factor defaults removes both your personal and work information from it.

1.  In your browser, open the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com), and sign in to your work account.

2.  Tap **My Devices** and select the name of the lost of stolen  device.

3.  Click **Reset** &gt; **Reset**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are unable to reset your lost or stolen device, ask your IT administrator to reset it for you.
