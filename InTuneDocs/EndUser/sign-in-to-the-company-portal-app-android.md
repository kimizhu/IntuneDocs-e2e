# Sign in to the Company Portal app

After you install the Company Portal app, you'll need to sign in to the app to enroll your device in Intune. Once you enroll, you can  sign in to the Company Portal anytime to download company apps and do other tasks. For more about what you can do, see [What happens when you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?](what-happens-when-you-install-the-Company-Portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-android.md).

1.  Tap **Company Portal** in your list of apps.

    If you are signing into the Company Portal app for the first time, and your company or school is using Intune, you will be prompted to enroll your device in Intune. To enroll, follow the steps in [Enroll your device in Intune](#BKMK_andr_enroll_devc).

    **For Android 6.0 or later devices only:**

    When you sign in to the Company Portal app for the first time to enroll your device, you see the message, **Allow Company Portal to make and manage phone calls?**. This message is misleading, because **Microsoft never makes or manages your phone calls!** Google controls the message text, so Microsoft cannot change it.  When you allow access, all you're doing is allowing the Company Portal app to see your phone number and an ID called an IMEI.

    If you deny access, the message will appear again the next time you sign in to the Company Portal, but you can turn off future messages by tapping the **Never ask again** check box.  If you later decide to allow access, go to **Settings** &gt; **Apps** &gt; **Company Portal** &gt; **Permissions** &gt; **Phone**, and then turn on the permission.
