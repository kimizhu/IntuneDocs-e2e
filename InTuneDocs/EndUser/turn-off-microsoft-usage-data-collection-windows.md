# Turn off Microsoft usage data collection

In order to improve its products and services, Microsoft automatically collects anonymous data about the reliability and performance of the Company Portal app and how it is used. You can turn off the collection of that data by using the **Usage Data** setting in the Company Portal app. IT administrators have no control over the collection of the data, and they cannot change your selection for the setting.
