# What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?

You start by installing the Company Portal app, and then use the app to enroll your device in Intune. Once your device is enrolled, you  can use the Company Portal app to:

-   Get company apps from the Company Portal

-   Automatically configure your company email account

-   Reset your phone to factory settings if it is lost or stolen
