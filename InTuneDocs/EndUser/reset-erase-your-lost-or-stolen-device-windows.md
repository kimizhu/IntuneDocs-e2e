# Reset (erase) your lost or stolen device

If your enrolled device is lost or stolen, you can reset it to factory defaults from the Company Portal app or website. For instructions using the Company Portal app, use the following steps. To use the Company Portal website, see ___________________________.


> [!WARNING]
> Resetting a device to factor defaults removes both your personal and work information from it. For more about what happens when you reset your device, see [What happens if you reset your device using the Company Portal?](what-happens-if-you-reset-your-device-using-the-company-portal-windows.md).

1.  In your browser, open your Company Portal, and sign in to your work account.

2.  Under **My Devices**, select the lost or stolen device.

3.  Tap **Reset** &gt; **Reset**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are unable to reset your lost or stolen device, contact IT to reset it for you.
