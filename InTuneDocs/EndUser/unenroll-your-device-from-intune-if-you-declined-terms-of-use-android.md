# Unenroll your device from Intune if you declined Terms of Use

Use these instructions to unenroll from Intune only if you declined the Terms of Use while trying to sign in to the Company Portal app.  When you decline the Terms, you cannot sign in to the Company Portal app. To unenroll your device, you generally use the Company Portal app, so these instructions are a workaround method for unenrolling when you have declined the Terms. The best way to unenroll your device is to accept the Terms, sign in to the Company Portal app, and then unenroll.  See [Unenroll your device from Intune](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-android).

When you uninstall the Company Portal app, you are also unenrolling your device from Intune, which means that your device will no longer be able to access company resources.  For more about what happens when you unenroll, see [What happens when you unenroll your device from Intune?](what-happens-when-you-unenroll-your-device-from-intune-android.md).

Before you can uninstall the Company Portal app, you have to go to the **Device administrators** setting, and turn off **Company Portal**. The steps may differ a little, depending on which Android device you have.

To unenroll your device from Intune and uninstall the Company Portal app:

1.  Go to **Settings** &gt; **Security &amp; Screen Lock** &gt; **Device administrators**.

    Completing this step immediately unenrolls your device.

2.  Clear the check box next to, or turn off, **Company Portal**.

    You can now uninstall the Company Portal app.
