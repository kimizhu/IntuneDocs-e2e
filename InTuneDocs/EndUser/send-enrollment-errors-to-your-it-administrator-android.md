# Send enrollment errors to your IT administrator

If you get an error while trying to enroll your device in Intune, you can try enrolling again by tapping **Retry**, or send the error information to your IT admin in an email by tapping **Send info**. An email, addressed to your IT administrator, is automatically created and contains the logs that your IT admin needs to help troubleshoot your device.
