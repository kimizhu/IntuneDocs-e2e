# Encrypt your device

If your company or organization requires you to encrypt your device before you can access company files, email, or data, follow these steps to encrypt your device:

1.  Ensure that your device is connected to the charger.

2.  Tap **Search**. In the Search box, type **company portal**.

3.  Ensure that a screen lock PIN or password has been set for your device.

4.  In Settings, click **Security** &gt; **Encrypt Phone**.
    (On some phones, youâ€™ll need to click **Storage** &gt; **Storage encryption**).

5.  Follow the on-screen instructions. During encryption, your device might restart several times.

6.  Ensure that your device is enrolled with Microsoft Intune by following the instructions in [Enroll your device in Microsoft Intune](enroll-your-device-in-Intune-android.md).
