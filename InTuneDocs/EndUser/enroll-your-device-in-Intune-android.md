# Enroll your Android device in Intune

The instructions for enrolling are different for a Samsung Knox Android device versus a "native," non-Samsung Knox Android device. To determine if you have a Samsung Knox device, go to **Settings** &gt; **About phone**. If you don't see the word  "Knox" listed there, follow these enrollment instructions.

Before or after enrolling, you may be asked to choose a category that best describes how you use your device. Your IT administrator uses this category to help determine what apps you have access to.

For instructions with screenshots, see [Intune End-user enrollment instructions](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/End-user-Intune-enrollment-55dfd64a).

2.  If your IT admin set up company terms and conditions, tap **ACCEPT** to accept the terms.

    
    If you see a message asking if you will allow the Company Portal to access your contacts or to make and manage phone calls, tap **ALLOW**. Microsoft does NOT access your contacts or manage your phone calls. See "For Android 6.0 or later devices only" in [Sign in to the Company Portal](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt502762(TechNet.10).aspx#BKMK_andr_enroll_devc) for details.

5. Review a list of what your IT admin can and can't see on your device, and tap **CONTINUE**.
 
6. On the **What comes next** screen, read about what happens during enrollment, and then tap **ENROLL**.
 
7. On the **Activate device administrator** screen, tap **Activate**.

8.  Follow the prompts to enter a PIN or password. If you already set up a PIN or password on this device, you won't see this screen or be required to enter a new PIN or password.
  
9.  On the  **Name the certificate** screen, tap **OK** to accept the default certificate.
  
    The messages "Enrolling your device" and "microsoft workaccount is installed" appear.

11. On the **Company Access Setup complete** screen, tap **DONE**.

12. Before trying to install company apps, go to **Settings** > **Security**, and turn on **Unknown sources**. If you don't turn on this option before trying to install apps, you'll see the message "Install blocked." For security reasons, your phone is set to block installations of apps obtained from unknown sources." You can tap **Settings** on the error dialog to go to the **Unknown sources** option.
