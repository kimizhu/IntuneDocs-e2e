# Device doesn't have Secure Boot enabled

Your organization requires that you enable Windows Secure Boot, which is a security feature that helps to protect your device. 

Enabling Secure Boot is an advanced task. If you are using a mobile device, contact your IT administrator for help. 

If you are using a PC, you can contact your IT administrator, or see the section “To re-enable Secure Boot” on the [Disabling Secure Boot](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn898540(v=vs.85).aspx) page to try enabling Secure Boot yourself.
