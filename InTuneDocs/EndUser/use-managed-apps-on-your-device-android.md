# Use managed apps on your device

Managed apps are apps that your IT administrator can configure to help protect company data that you can access in that app. When you access company data in a managed app, you may notice that the app works a little differently from what you expect. For example, you might not be able to copy and paste protected company data, or you might not be able to save that data to certain locations.

Different managed apps can also work together on your device to allow you to do your daily tasks, while keeping corporate data protected. For example, if you open a company file in one managed app, and another managed app is required to view that file, the managed app that allows you to view the file opens automatically. If a required app is not available, certain actions, like opening a document or accessing a web link from within a managed document, might not be available.

When you access company data in a managed app, you see a message like the one below, which lets you know that the app you are opening is managed.

## How do I get managed apps?
You get managed apps in a couple of different ways:

-   When your device is enrolled in Microsoft Intune, you either install the app from your Company Portal app or Company Portal website, or your IT admin might install it on your device. To find out about enrollment, see [Enroll your device in Intune](enroll-your-device-in-Intune-android.md).

-   You install an app from the Play Store and then sign in with your corporate user account that is managed by Intune.

## What can my IT admin manage in an app?
Here are some examples of options that your IT admin can manage in an app and that can affect your interactions with company data on your device:

-   Access to specific websites

-   Transfers of data between apps

-   Saving files

-   Copy and paste operations

-   PIN access requirements

-   Your login, using company credentials

-   Ability to back up to the cloud

-   Ability to take screenshots

-   Data encryption requirements

Some common apps that your IT department might manage are:

-   Managed web browser
