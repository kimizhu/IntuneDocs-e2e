# Device doesn't have antimalware software enabled

Your organization requires that you enable Windows early-launch antimalware (ELAM), which is a security feature that helps to protect your device when it starts up. 

This requirement applies only to Windows 10 devices. For instructions on how to enable ELAM for Windows 10 desktops, laptops, or tablets, see [How to turn on Early-Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM)](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/How-to-turn-on-Early-84552ec5).
