# What is the Company Portal website?

The [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) is your companyâ€™s web interface that you use to manage your work computers and devices, and your personal computers and devices that you choose to use at work. You can do most of the same tasks on this website that you can do by using the Company Portal app that you install on your device.

You can do the following tasks from the Company Portal website:

-   Browse for and download company apps

-   Rename your device

-   Remove your device from Intune

-   Reset your mobile device to its factory default settings

-   Find contact information for your IT administrator
