# Data security with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] is a cloud-based service where the infrastructure that hosts your data is managed for you in Azure datacenters. The cloud-based storage of data can raise a number of questions that often include the following:

-   Who has access to the data?

-   Where does [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](./includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] store data when using Microsoft Azure?

-   How is data secured, including transfer between clients, web consoles, and the cloud?

-   How is the privacy of data assured?

-   Who owns the data?

-   Is there any third-party verification?

These and additional data security questions are answered in the [Microsoft Intune Privacy and Data Protection Overview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528219) white paper.
