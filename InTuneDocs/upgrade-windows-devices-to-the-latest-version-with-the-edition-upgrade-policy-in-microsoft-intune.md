# Upgrade Windows devices to the latest version with the edition upgrade policy in Microsoft Intune
The [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](/Token/wit_firstref.xml)] **Edition Upgrade Policy** lets you automatically upgrade devices that run one of the following Windows 10 versions to a newer edition:
* Windows 10 Desktop
* Windows 10 Holographic
* Windows 10 Mobile

Before you begin to upgrade devices to the latest version, you will need one of the following:
* A product key which is valid to install the new version of Windows on all devices you target with the policy
* A licence file from Microsoft which contains the licensing information to install the new version of Windows on all devices you target with the policy.

## Configure the edition upgrade policy

1. In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy**.
2. In the Policy workspace, click **Configuration Policies** > **Add**.
3. In the **Create a New Policy** dialog box, expand **Windows**, and then click one of the following policies:
