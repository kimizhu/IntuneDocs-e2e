# Stacie What&#39;s New

## Changes and updates to Microsoft Company Portal
The following changes have been made to the company portal apps in this release:

**Android Company Portal app**

-   When your users launch an app that is managed by mobile application management (MAM), they will see a message notifying them that the app is managed by their company. Users can now tap a “Learn More” link to get [more information](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt502762.aspx#BKMK_andr_use_mgd_apps) here about what “managed apps” means. They can also tap “Don’t Show Again” so that the message no longer appears when they launch the app.

**iOS Company Portal app**
