# What&#39;s coming in Microsoft Intune
This information is provided under NDA on an extremely limited basis and is subject to change. Some features listed here are at risk of not making the cutoff dates and may be delayed until a future release. Other features are being tested in a pilot (flighting) to ensure they're customer-ready. Please reach out to your Intune/PM buddy if you have any questions or concerns.

This page is updated periodically. Check back for new What’s Coming updates.
## New in service
The following changes are under development for Intune: 
### App management

- **The Rights Management sharing app is supported for Android.** IT administrators can deploy mobile application management policies so end users can view images, AV, and PDF files more securely, whether or not IT uses Intune to manage the devices.
